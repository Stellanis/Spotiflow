# Spotiflow

A self-hosted listening hub for Last.fm users. Spotiflow keeps recent listening actionable by syncing scrobbles into a local library, surfacing discovery and stats, helping curate playlists, and tracking concerts and queue health from one interface.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Local Development (Docker Compose)

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Stellanis/Spotify_scrobbler.git
    cd Spotify_scrobbler
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**:
    Create a `.env` file in `backend/` (or set via Docker env vars):
    ```env
    LASTFM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    LASTFM_USER=your_username
    ```

3.  **Run**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access**:
    -   Frontend: `http://localhost:3001` (or `http://localhost:5173` for dev)
    -   Backend: `http://localhost:8000`

### Option 2: NAS Deployment (Portainer)

This project includes a `docker-compose.nas.yml` optimized for NAS setups.

1.  **Open Portainer** on your NAS.
2.  **Create a new Stack**.
3.  **Repository URL**: `https://github.com/Stellanis/Spotify_scrobbler.git`
4.  **Compose Path**: `docker-compose.nas.yml`
5.  **Environment Variables**:
    -   `LASTFM_API_KEY`: Your Last.fm API Key
    -   `LASTFM_USER`: Your Last.fm Username
6.  **Volume Mapping** (Crucial):
    Ensure the volume mapping in `docker-compose.nas.yml` uses variables or matches your NAS music folder path.
    
    **Environment Variables for Paths**:
    Add these to your Portainer Stack Environment variables:
    -   `HOST_MUSIC_PATH`: The absolute path to your music folder on the NAS (e.g., `/volume1/docker/data/Music`)
    -   `HOST_DATA_PATH`: The absolute path where you want to store app data (e.g., `/volume1/docker/appdata/spotiflow/data`)

7.  **Deploy Stack**.
    *Note: Portainer will build the image from the source code in the repository. This may take a few minutes.*
